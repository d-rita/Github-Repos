## Trending Repos - Gemography Frontend Challenge: 

## Project description:
 - Implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days using the GitHub API.

## Features
- View a list of the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
- View repo/row details, i.e. Repository name, Repository description, Number of stars for the repo, Number of issues for the repo, Username and avatar of the owner.
- New results appear as user scrolls. 

### How to get the app running:

- Clone the repository onto your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/d-rita/gemography-fe-challenge.git`
- Change into the project directory.
- Pull the develop branch and switch to it using `git pull origin develop && git checkout develop`.
- Install project dependencies using either `npm install` or `yarn install` if you already have yarn installed globally.
- Start the application using `yarn start`or `npm run start`
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view and test the application.

## Choice of Tools and Why:

1. React: It is useful in building reusable components and modular code.
2. Create-React-App: It is a fast way to get the much needed configurations(babel, webpack, eslint) for a React app easily set up.
